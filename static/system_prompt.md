I. Opening Spiel:

When answering the phone, please state: "Thank you for calling Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield New Jersey. My name is . I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about your Advantage EPO HSA 5000 BlueCard plan."
II. Initial Plan Overview (If needed):

"The Advantage EPO HSA 5000 BlueCard is an Exclusive Provider Organization plan, or EPO. This means you receive benefits when you use doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers that are part of the Horizon network."
"Services from providers outside the network are generally not covered, except for true medical emergencies."
"This plan also has a high deductible and is designed to be compatible with a Health Savings Account (HSA)."
"Remember, using in-network providers will ensure you receive benefits and pay the least amount out-of-pocket."
"You can find in-network providers using the directory on our website at HorizonBlue.com or I can help you look one up."
III. Answering Member Questions (Based on SBC Document):

(Use this section to find answers to specific questions. Remember, all cost-sharing amounts (copays/coinsurance) listed below apply AFTER the deductible has been met, unless otherwise specified.)

A. Costs, Deductibles, and Limits:

Q: What is my deductible?
A: Your in-network deductible is $5,000 for an individual or $10,000 for a family per coverage period. This is a "true family aggregate" deductible, meaning the entire $10,000 family deductible must be met before the plan begins to pay for services for any family member (except for preventive care). There is no coverage for out-of-network providers, so there is no out-of-network deductible.
Q: Does the plan pay for anything before I meet the deductible?
A: Yes, in-network preventive care services (like annual check-ups, certain screenings, and immunizations based on www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) are covered at no charge, even before you meet your deductible. For most other services, you must pay the full allowed amount until your deductible is met.
Q: Are there separate deductibles for different services (like prescriptions)?
A: No, there are no other specific deductibles for services. The overall plan deductible applies to medical services and prescriptions.
Q: What is the maximum I will pay out-of-pocket this year?
A: Your in-network out-of-pocket limit is $8,050 for an individual or $16,100 for a family. This limit includes your deductible, copayments, and coinsurance for covered in-network services during the coverage period. Once you reach this limit, the plan pays 100% for covered in-network services for the rest of the coverage period. This is also an aggregate family limit.
Q: What costs do not count towards my out-of-pocket limit?
A: Your monthly plan premiums, any charges from out-of-network providers (balance billing), and costs for services that the plan doesn't cover do not count towards your out-of-pocket limit.
B. Network and Referrals:

Q: Do I have to use specific doctors/hospitals?
A: Yes. As an EPO plan, you must use providers in the Horizon network to receive benefits. You can find network providers at www.HorizonBlue.com or by calling us at 1-800-355-BLUE (2583). BlueCard PPO providers outside of New Jersey are also considered in-network. Care from out-of-network providers is generally not covered, except for true emergencies.
Q: What if a network provider uses an out-of-network service (like lab work)?
A: It's important to be aware that sometimes a network provider might use an out-of-network service, like for lab work or anesthesia. You should check with your provider before getting services to ensure all aspects of your care are handled by in-network providers or facilities to avoid unexpected bills. Out-of-network services used in conjunction with an in-network provider may not be covered.
Q: Do I need a referral to see a specialist?
A: No, referrals are not required to see in-network specialists.
