# Can you create a database model to store plan information? This should have the database ID for the plan, and then it should have a short plan name, and then it should have a full plan name, and then it should also have a column to store the summary of benefits document,  and then it should have a column to store the summary of benefits document URL, and then it should have a column to store the compressed summary of benefits document.  All of the columns should just be a text field in my PostgreSQL database, and I want to manage this database using SQLAlchemy.
